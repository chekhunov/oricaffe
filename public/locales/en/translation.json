To preserve the taste, they are packaged in foil with the addition of nitrogen, which better preserves the aroma and prolongs the life of ground coffee. Properly packaged pods can be stored for up to 2 years without losing their essential characteristics. Coffee in a pod is the perfect solution for the office: quick, convenient and always delicious, but you will need a special pod coffee maker to make it.

The biggest advantage of these machines is the speed and ease of making coffee, as well as easy maintenance. Nespresso capsules are pre-packaged ground roasted coffee, pressed into portioned disposable sealed plastic or metal capsules, which are small cups with a lid. The preparation of the drink is carried out in a special machine that provides simultaneous perforation of the bottom of the capsule and its lid, while high-pressure water is injected into the capsule through the bottom, and the finished drink is discharged from the place of preparation into the cup through the lid. To fill the capsules, manufacturers often use coffee blends consisting of several varieties of ground coffee beans. Also, the capsule does not allow air, moisture and sunlight to pass through. The coffee is always fresh.",
